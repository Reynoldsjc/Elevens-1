Activity 5:


Buggy1: file - Deck.java

Describe a Possible Code Error:
The isEmpty() method in the Deck Class has not been created correctly because it should be returning true but instead it returns false. There must be just a small error that checks to see the size.



Buggy2: file - Deck.java

Describe a Possible Code Error:
The size() method in the Deck class was written incorrectly, the actual size of the deck is one card while the test says the Deck is empty which is not right. They must have used the incorrect method to find the size.



Buggy3: file - Card.java

Describe a Possible Code Error:
The matches() method written in Card is written incorrectly while the decks should match as they are the same. They donâ€™t match so a possible error could be comparing the wrong variables. Since isEmpty() is based on size, that may be the source of the errors.


Buggy4: file - Deck.java

Describe a Possible Code error:
The Deal() method is not correctly running because it thinks the deck is not containing any cards. The method ran null even though there is a card in that deck. So the isEmpty() method that was used earlier is messing up its return statement. Although, there are many other possibilities because the Deal method calls several different functions.
